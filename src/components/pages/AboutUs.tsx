                  In Sunlit Sea we truly believe that a solid company culture forms the basis of any
                  robust brand. This not merely covers what happens inside our own office walls, but
                  more importantly how we interact with the outside world. Therefore, we strive for
                  transparency and open data processes. Our company encourages the public to
                  challenge our design basis through open source practice, which helps push
                  development.

                  In Sunlit Sea we share as we learn - a key factor if you strive to reach a common
                  vision. We are convinced that to break new ground, you must dare think
                  differently. Consequently we cherish the ability to explore and be ambitious in
                  our work.

                  fail. For this reason our company is fault tolerant. Henceforth, we firmly think
                  that our ability to be respectful reflects in our work, our relationships and

                  Being a startup is a true challenge. For many it would not be possible to exist
                  without support and endorsement. Sunlit Sea has been able to further develop due
                  to financial programs and incentive schemes provided by Innovation Norway and The
                  Research Council of Norway. This has helped form the foundation of what could
                  become a new industrial fairy tale.

                  All our partners have contributed either as part of the core team, or in critical
                  phases of product development with cutting-edge expertise, support and marketing
                  of our technology. Sunlit Sea will continue to build alliances and partner
                  networks in the future. Norway has enormous experience and expertise to draw on
                  both from offshore and solar power. Together with our partners we will show that
                  Norway is the world{"'"}s leading energy nation!
